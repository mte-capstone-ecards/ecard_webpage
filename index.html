I need to create a basic website to showcase a project, what would be a good platform to quickly do that? 
ChatGPT said:
For a quick and effective way to showcase your project, consider these options:

GitHub Pages â€“ If your project is on GitHub, you can host a simple static site for free. Supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jekyll.

Pros: Free, easy to set up, supports custom domains.
Cons: Requires a GitHub repository.
Netlify â€“ Great for static sites with easy deployment from GitHub.

Pros: Free tier, continuous deployment, custom domain support.
Cons: Might require some setup if you're new to it.
Vercel â€“ Ideal for React and Next.js projects.

Pros: Fast deployment, good for dynamic content.
Cons: Slightly more complex than GitHub Pages.
Carrd â€“ If you want something very simple and aesthetic.

Pros: Drag-and-drop interface, very quick setup.
Cons: Limited customization on the free plan.
WordPress.com â€“ Good for blog-style or content-heavy pages.

Pros: Easy to use, lots of templates.
Cons: Free plan has ads and limited features.
Google Sites â€“ If you need something super quick with zero coding.

Pros: Free, integrates with Google services.
Cons: Limited design flexibility.
If you need something very quick and simple, Carrd or Google Sites work well. If you want more control, GitHub Pages or Netlify are great. Which one suits your needs best?

Got it! I'll create a simple webpage with a dropdown menu and the title Noname Ecards, similar in style to the example you provided. I'll generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for you. Give me a moment.

do i just put this in its own file in my github project? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes! Follow these steps to add it to your GitHub Pages project:

Create an HTML file

Save the provided code as index.html in your GitHub repository.
Push it to GitHub

If your project is already set up on GitHub, just add and commit the file:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add basic Noname Ecards webpage"
git push
Enable GitHub Pages (if not already enabled)

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Click Settings > Pages.
Under Branch, select main (or your default branch).
Click Save.
Access your site

Your website should be live at:
https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/
Let me know if you need help with any step! ðŸš€

When I go there it just looks like the strandard webpage? https://mte-capstone-ecards.github.io/ecard_webpage/ 
ChatGPT said:
It looks like GitHub Pages might not be serving your index.html correctly. Try these steps to fix it:

Check GitHub Pages Settings

Go to Settings â†’ Pages in your repository.
Ensure Source is set to the correct branch (main in your case).
If needed, change it and click Save.
Ensure index.html is in the root directory

GitHub Pages requires index.html to be in the root of the repository (or inside a /docs folder if configured that way).
Your file is in the repository, so this is likely fine.
Force a Refresh

Sometimes GitHub Pages caches the page. Try Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to refresh.
Check for Errors in Console

Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I in Chrome) and check the Console for errors.
Wait a Few Minutes

GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after a push.
If it still doesnâ€™t work, let me know what you see when visiting the page! ðŸš€
